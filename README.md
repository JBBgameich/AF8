# AF8 - Minetest Subgame
### A new Work-In-Progess Minetest-Subgame wrote completely from scratch, licensed under LGPLv2.1/CC BY-SA 3.0.

## Goals
- get a clean mod structure (and not: dye, default, farming, wool, doors, ...)
- being a replacement for my game TNG in LGPL, not GPL. That also means rewrite all code that is GPL (by BlockMen, kilbith, ...)
- create a game, where you don't need a mod for everything
- don't modify, implent features

## TODO
1. Alpha-Phase
  - create a clean mod structure (Where should be what?)
  - Add most basic features of TNG and MTG into the clean mod structure
  - Here can be changed EVERYTHING

2. Beta-Phase
  - Here still can be changed much, but the game should be nearing a stable state, and there should not be created more mods
  - Worlds created in the beta, have to be compatible with any later version
  - Add a legacy mod for aliases, deprecated funcs, ...
  - Fix all bugs
  - Give the game a real name, to make it ready for v1.0

3. Done! - v1.0
  - Mods created for v1.0 have to be compatible with any later version
  - Here can be added new features, but mods for v1.0 should be compatible with every later version.
